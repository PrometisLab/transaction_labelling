Imputed rentals also include payment for the use of a garage that provides parking in connection with the dwelling but does not have to be physically contiguous to the dwelling.

Imputed rentals do not include payment for the use of garages or parking spaces that provide parking not in connection with the dwelling (07.2.4).

04.3;Maintenance, repair and security of the dwelling;"Maintenance and repair of dwellings are activities that are distinguished by two features: first, they have to be undertaken regularly if the dwelling is to remain in good working order; second, they do not change the dwelling’s performance, capacity or expected service life.

There are two types of maintenance and repair of dwellings: those that are minor, such as interior decoration and repair to fittings and that are commonly carried out by both tenants and owner-occupiers, or major, such as replastering walls or repairing roofs, which are carried out only by owners.

Only the expenditures incurred by tenants and owner-occupiers on materials and services related to interior decoration and to other such minor maintenance and repair, which would normally be seen as the responsibility of a tenant, are considered part of the individual consumption expenditure of households.

Expenditure incurred by owners, including owner-occupiers, on dwelling-related interior decoration and minor maintenance and repair that would normally be seen as the responsibility of a landlord, are considered intermediate expenditure and should not be treated as final consumption expenditure of households. Expenditure incurred by owners, including owner-occupiers, on major maintenance and repair are seen as gross fixed capital formation and thus also outside the scope of COICOP.

Materials purchased by tenants or owner-occupiers with the intention of undertaking minor maintenance or repair themselves should be assigned to subclass 04.3.1.1. If tenants or owner-occupiers pay an enterprise to carry out the minor maintenance or repair, the total value of the services, including the costs of the materials used, should be assigned to subclass 04.3.2.0. However, the cost of the materials should be assigned to 04.3.1.1 if they are separately priced.";;;

07;Transport;"Under division 07, goods and services for the purpose of transportation are classified within four main categories: purchase of vehicles (07.1), goods and services associated with the operation of personal transport equipment (07.2), passenger transport services (07.3) and transport services of goods (07.4).

Purchase of vehicles covers motor cars, motorcycles, bicycles and animal-drawn vehicles. Owing to the high share of second-hand motor vehicles in private consumption expenditures, separate subclasses for new and second-hand motor cars have been established.

Group 07.2 (operation of personal transport equipment) covers parts and accessories and fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment and the repair and maintenance of that equipment. Also included in this group are expenditures for parking spaces in garages and public places, expenditures on tolls and expenditures associated with the acquisition of a driving licence.

Passenger transport services (07.3) are structured based on the mode of transport. However, since transport tickets may be for travel using more than one mode of transport, a class covering combined passenger transport (07.3.6) was created.

Group 07.4 covers postal and courier services, as well as removal and storage services and delivery services of any kinds of goods, if separately priced.

Division 07, however, does not cover purchases of recreational vehicles, such as camper vans, caravans, trailers, aeroplanes and boats (09.1.2).";;;

12;Insurance and financial services;"Division 12 covers insurance (12.1) and financial services (12.2). Insurance and financial services are provided by financial corporations. These may be paid for explicitly or implicitly. Some transactions in financial assets may also involve both explicit and implicit charges. Implicit charges are not always as evident, given that the way in which charges are made for most goods and services and are typically calculated using a number of observable transactions. Examples of implicit charges arise from the financial services provided in association with interest charges on loans and deposits, the acquisition and disposal of financial assets and liabilities in financial markets, and insurance and pension schemes. The imputed values of expenditure on insurance and financial services are not directly observable from household income and expenditure surveys.

Insurance services are subdivided by type of insurance. Financial services are subdivided by financial intermediation services indirectly measured and by the other forms of actual and indirect charges and remittance fees for financial services. For the definition and the measurement of the insurance and financial services, specific national account concepts (2008 SNA) do apply.";;;
12.1;Insurance;"Service charges for insurance are classified by type of insurance, namely, life insurance and non-life insurance (i.e., insurance in connection with the dwelling, health, transport, etc.). Service charges for multi-risk insurance covering several risks should be classified on the basis of the cost of the principal risk if it is not possible to allocate the service charges to the various risks covered.

The basic method for measuring the service charge for non-life insurance is total premiums earned plus investment income earned from investing the premiums, less adjusted claims incurred.

The basic method for measuring the service charge for life insurance is premiums earned plus investment income earned from investing the premiums, less benefits due to fewer increases (plus decreases) in life insurance technical reserves.";;;
